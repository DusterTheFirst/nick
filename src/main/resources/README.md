# README

These files are used to store information and configure the nick plugin
Source code for this plugin can be found on [github](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/nick)

## Files in this directory

There are 2 files in this directory, excluding this one. The `config.yml` is user editable and should be configured with your setup.
You have to restart the server for changes to the config to be applied. The `players.yml` file holds information about user's nicknames and such
and should only ever be edited in game through the `/nick`, `/color` and other commands. If you **MUST** edit this file, do so when the server is off or else
the changes you make will not be saved.
